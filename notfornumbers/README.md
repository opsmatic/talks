The beginnings of my Monitorama EU talk. So far a loosely connected series of
thoughts written out about the way I'd say them. Lots of editing for style,
tone, and continuity still to be done, and a few more sections to fill out.

* `notes.md` is just a pile of notes on random relevant topics + abstract that
was submitted to monitorama
* `talk.md` is a stream of consciousness I will eventually turn into slides
* Various jpegs are referenced throughout the `talk.md` file and will be used in the slides.
