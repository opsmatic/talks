.notes So while we were discussing all this, we attended a happy hour demo event
at a coworking space. Suddenly the internet went down. The hosts had a backup
internet line, and the Cisco Catalyst in the network closet was theoretically
configured to fail over, but that did not happen. To make matters MORE
interesting, the whole thing had been set up by a contractor who had since been
fired. Nobody, including the new contractor, knew how the damn thing was set up.
So Jay literally sat down and telnetted to a Cisco Catalyst and figured the
configuration out, all while having graphic violent flashbacks to his days at
NetCom. We knew then that our general premise was correct and we had work to do.

want any photobombing tips afterwards.
